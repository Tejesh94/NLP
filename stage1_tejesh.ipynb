       "'Qatar Petroleum  QP is targeting aggressive cuts in its greenhouse gas emissions as it prepares to launch Phase 2 of its planned 48 million ton per year LNG expansion In its latest Sustainability Report published on Wednesday QP said its goals include  reducing the emissions intensity of Qatars LNG facilities by 25 and of its upstream facilities by at least 15  The company is also aiming to reduce gas flaring intensity across its upstream facilities by more than 75 and has raised its carbon capture and storage ambitions from 5 million tonsyr to 7 million tonsyr by 2027 About 22 million tonsyr of the carbon capture goal will come from the 32 million tonyr Phase 1 of the LNG expansion also known as the North Field East project A further 11 million tonsyr will come from Phase 2 known as the North Field South project which will raise Qatars LNG capacity by a further 16 million tonsyr Qatar currently has an LNG production capacity of around 78 million tonsyr and is eyeing a phased expansion to 126 million tonsyr QP says it should be able to eliminate routine gas flaring by 2030 with methane emissions limited  by setting a methane intensity target of 02 across all facilities by 2025  The company also plans to build some 16 gigawatts of solar energy capacity by 2025 half of which should come from the Siraj solar power project next year  EIF Jan2220 Until this month there had been little news about Phase 2 of Qatars massive LNG expansion But McDermott International said last week that it had been awarded the frontend engineering and design contract for five offshore wellhead platforms  LNGI Jan1221 Bids for construction of all four trains for Phase 1 of the LNG expansion were submitted in September  LNGI Sep1520 But QP judged them to be too expensive and none met its targeted 50week construction schedule Shortlisted contractors were asked to look for cost savings and submit new bids The contract which consultancy Rystad estimates to be worth around  35 billion is expected to be awarded by Mar 31 Shortly after the construction contract is awarded QP is expected to select foreign investments partners to take stakes of up to 30 in the Phase 1 trains Exxon Mobil Royal Dutch Shell Total Chevron ConocoPhillips and Eni have been shortlisted QP has repeatedly said that it is prepared to proceed without international investment partners if it determines that the offers it receives are not sufficiently attractive But the shortlisted companies are expected to bid aggressively for what is expected to be the worlds lowestcost and most environmentally friendly LNG  LNGI Nov920 Rafiq Latta Nicosia'"
